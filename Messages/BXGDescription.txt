Boxing is a combat sport that involves fighting with fists. Traditionally, boxing has also 
been referred to as “pugilism,” which literally means, “fist fight.” Fights take place in 
an area called a “ring,” and consist of timed rounds. Winners are decided by points or by
knocking out an opponent. A referee runs the fight inside the ring while judges outside the 
ring ultimately decide who wins the match.
