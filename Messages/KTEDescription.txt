Karate is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan
martial arts (called te (æ‰‹), "hand"; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, 
particularly Fujian White Crane. Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking,
 knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands and 
palm-heel strikes.
